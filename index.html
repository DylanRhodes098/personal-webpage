            <p class="project_description"> I was involved in constructing githubs desktop product. On my own, without any team, developed githubs interface and backend wiring along with the creation of repositories, md files and the branch system. My short experience in full-stack development (just over a week) has given me the skills to develop a system like githubs. Was a short project, taking around 2 weeks to fully finalise, and I am excited for future prospects down the line where I can showcase my expertise in full-stack development.</p>

            <p class="project_description">I single-handedly built amazon's website, both frontend and backend development. It was relatively easy, took me just 1 weekend! I implemented my vast knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with my backend knowledge inIJava, C++, Perl, and Python. Also fully automated their database which involved DynamoDB and Redshift. To conclude, I would love to be involved in something simple like this and am excited for future projects that await me.</p>
